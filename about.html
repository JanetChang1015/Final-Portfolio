            <h1>About:</h1>
            <h1>This is my personal portfolio. The main purpose of this website is to show all the art and digital works I have done before. Some of them are my individual works and some of them are group works from my classes. If you click on the artwork, it will show the intention and what I was thinking about when I created the work., I plan to add more work here in the future so I can see the development of my skills. Hopefully, in the future, my artwork can keep improving.</h1>
